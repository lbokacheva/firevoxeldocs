FireVoxel (the "SOFTWARE") is provided to the USER under the following conditions:

#. USER will not supply the Software to anyone else (including, without
   limitation, other investigators and other laboratories) without the prior written
   permission of New York University School of Medicine ("NYUSM").


#. No studies other than those specifically AGREED TO will be conducted with the

   copies of the Software as required to perform the studies agreed to. If additional
   studies are desired, they may be added and approved by us.


#. The Software is supplied solely for academic and non-profit research purposes
   and shall not be used for any commercial or other purposes whatsoever. USER shall not
   use the Software in conjunction with projects directly funded by for-profit corporations.

#. USER will inform NYUSM of the results of any studies performed by it with the Software.
   USER agrees it will not disclose the results of its use of the Software to any entity or
   any investigator or publish any data or information relating to the Software or studies
   with it, prior to disclosure in writing to NYUSM and allowing NYUSM a period of 45 days
   from the date of receipt of such disclosure to determine whether or not patent protection
   should be sought and to file a patent application if appropriate.  After the expiration of
   such 45-day period, or earlier if NYUSM advises that patent protection will not be sought,
   USER will be free to disclose or publish the results.  In any such publication, you agree
   to acknowledge NYUSM as the source of the Software unless we otherwise request.


#. NYUSM hereby excludes any and all warranties, implied or express, including warranties

   of Software, and in the event such invention should be commercialized, USER shall promptly
   notify NYUSM.  All income and/or other commercial returns and considerations received
   by USER that are associated with the commercialization and exploitation of such invention
   shall be shared in proportion to the relative contribution of the parties.


#. Neither anything contained herein nor the delivery of the Software shall be deemed
   to grant USER any right or licenses under any patents or patent application or under
   any know-how, technology or inventions owned by us.
