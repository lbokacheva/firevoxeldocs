====================

System Requirements
--------------------

FireVoxel runs on 64-bit Windows, Win7 and later.
Windows XP and 32-bit Windows are not supported.

Step-by-Step Instructions
-------------------------

1. Download FireVoxel*.zip `HERE <https://www.juliarun.org/319.zip>`_.
   The current build is: **319**.

2. Extract all files to your application folder, typically named FireVoxel.
   Don’t install FireVoxel within Program Files.
   Program Files protection may prevent FireVoxel to deal with its Temp subfolder.

3. If you have previously installed the program on your PC, extract \*.zip
   to existing folder and overwrite old files. Done!

4. Run *FireVoxel.exe*. If you get an error message about a missing .DLL file,
   install Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2019 and 2013 x64 redistributable packages
   (both are needed). Download them from `Microsoft support page`_ and install.

5. Start *FireVoxel.exe*.
   You will get an error message: FireVoxel.key not found, another location?
   Answer **No**. Another message lets you know that computer ID is ready to be pasted.

6. Email your ID number to hr18@nyu.edu. Use CTRL-V to paste computer ID to the email.
   Don’t send screenshot graphics. In the email, please give your name,
   describe your project and let us know your place of work/study.

7. The reply will include a small file *FireVoxel.key* as an attachment.
   Save the attachment in your folder. Done!

8. Please download and use new versions as they become available.
   Your feedback is very important!
